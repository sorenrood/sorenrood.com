# User Research Consulting

I sometimes work with other software companies to help them understand more about their users.

At Replit, I help teams make decisions by facilitating interviews, beta tests, usability tests, and targeted surveys. I've spent a lot of time understanding the needs of our users -- and translating those needs into concrete product requirements.

If your company would benefit from a resourceful hybrid researcher/PM with experience building products for tens of millions of people, please reach out at sorenrood (at) gmail (dot) com or DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/roodsoren" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

I'm flexible and would love to help however I can.
