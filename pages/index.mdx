# SÃ¸ren Rood

I am a product manager at <a href="https://www.Replit.com" target="_blank">Replit</a> currently working on the core development experience. I've also worked on <a href="https://blog.replit.com/replit-famous" target="_blank">social</a>, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ghostwriter" target="_blank">Ghostwriter</a>, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/bounties" target="_blank">Bounties</a>, and more.

Before Replit, I was a software engineer where I built liquidity products (market makers) for various brokerages.
