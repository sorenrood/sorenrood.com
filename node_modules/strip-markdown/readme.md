This essentially removes everything but paragraphs and text nodes.

> This is one of the first remark plugins, before prefixing with `remark-` got
> cool.

## Note!

No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install strip-markdown
```

## Use

```js
var remark = require('remark')
var strip = require('strip-markdown')

remark()
  .use(strip)
  .process('Some *emphasis*, **importance**, and `code`.', function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Yields:

```txt
Some emphasis, importance, and code.
```
